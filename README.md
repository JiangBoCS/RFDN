# Recursive Feature Diversity Network for Audio Super-Resolution

## Abstract
Deep learning methods have been successfully applied to audio super-resolution tasks. Although deep learning methods have good performance, they are uncomfortably applied to real-world applications due to the large member of computations required. To address this problem, we focus on a lightweight model for achieving fast and accurate audio super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a Recursive Feature Diversity Networks (RFD-Nets), which is yet flexible for the effective lightweight audio super-resolution task. RFD-Nets are composed of a Recursive Feature Diversity (RFD) block and a Back-Projection (BP) block. Specifically, an RFD block is a recursive structure that can refine and extract multiple types of features. Subsequently, combining with up-and-down sampling structure of BP block, the proposed model can efficiently capture the deep relationships between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) audio pairs, thus yielding high-quality audio reconstruction. Furthermore, we collect seven different types of complex audio datasets for the audio super-resolution model training and generalization evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RFD-Nets can achieve superior accuracy on the proposed benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art methods while only requiring lower computation and memory.
