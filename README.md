If this paper is accepted, the code will be released as soon as possible.
## Abstract
Deep learning methods have been successfully applied to audio super-resolution tasks. Although deep learning methods have good performance, they are uncomfortably applied to real-world applications due to the large member of computations required. To address this problem, we focus on a lightweight model for achieving fast and accurate audio super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a Recursive Feature Diversity Networks (RFD-Nets), which is yet flexible for the effective lightweight audio super-resolution task. RFD-Nets are composed of a Recursive Feature Diversity (RFD) block and a Back-Projection (BP) block. Specifically, an RFD block is a recursive structure that can refine and extract multiple types of features. Subsequently, combining with up-and-down sampling structure of BP block, the proposed model can efficiently capture the deep relationships between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) audio pairs, thus yielding high-quality audio reconstruction. Furthermore, we collect seven different types of complex audio datasets for the audio super-resolution model training and generalization evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RFD-Nets can achieve superior accuracy on the proposed benchmark datasets against state-of-the-art methods while only requiring lower computation and memory.

Overall framework of Recursive Feature Diversity Networks (RFD-Nets) for audio super-resolution. Our model mainly contains two blocks, namely the Recursive Feature Diversity  (RFD) block and the Back-Projection (BP) block. The main function of RFD block is to extract more types of feature maps with as few parameters as possible. BP block can accurately capture the mutual mapping relationship between LR-HR audio pairs.
